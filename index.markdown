Hi! We're some redditors who just introduced an initiative ordinance, the Transparent Restaurant Pricing Act, for San Francisco to require restaurants to include surcharges in prices. This will be relevant in the event that [SB 1524](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/restaurant-junk-fees-exemption-bill-19497214.php) becomes law.


<details>
<summary>Why should we ban surcharges?</summary>
Mandatory surcharges are fundamentally misleading: they make prices look lower than they actually are and make you do a multiplication problem to find out what you need to pay.

<summary>Why now?</summary>

In October 2023, the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB478">Consumers Legal Remedies Act (SB 478)</a> become law. This banned "drip pricing" (a rising trend in which companies will shift some cost from the price of items into mandatory fees) in California, effective July 1, 2024. But then, in June 2024 — less than a month before the surcharge ban was set to take effect — legislators introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1524">SB 1524</a>, a last-minute attempt to carve out an exception for restaurants and bars to continue to engage in drip pricing. This measure is intended to close the SB 1524 loophole within San Francisco.

<details>
<summary>Will this raise prices?</summary>
Yes, but not really. This will require prices include fees that we are _already paying_. So while nominal prices go up, but effective prices we are paying stay virtually the same.

<details>
<summary>Will this lower prices? If so, will these cuts hurt workers? </summary>
No. This does not affect the business constraints in which restaurants operate: they still will be required to provide identical benefits to their workers

<details>
<summary>I like knowing that my money is supporting workers. Can businesses still include this information?</summary>
Yes. This ordinance only affects the advertised or listed prices of items. If the restaurant wants to list it on the receipt, they can do so. Consider an example: a current bill may be formatted as

* $100 food items
* $5 SF Mandate Surcharge
* Subtotal: $105
* Taxes: $9.06
* Total: $114.06

This bill could equivalently be formatted:

* $105 food items
* Subtotal: $105
* Taxes: $9.06
* Total: $114.06
* Note: $5 from your bill went towards the Healthy SF Fund (for example). Thank you!
